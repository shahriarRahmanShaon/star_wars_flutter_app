## ‚ö° API Fetching, Pagination & Search

The **SWAPI Explorer** app integrates an efficient **data fetching, pagination, and search system** to provide users with a smooth browsing experience.

### üåç **API Fetching: How Data is Retrieved**
The app fetches character data from the **SWAPI API** using a well-structured architecture.

- The **`BaseService`** class acts as the **core API service**, handling HTTP requests and responses.
- The **`CharacterRemoteDataSourceImpl`** interacts with `BaseService` to request:
  - **Character data** (`fetchCharacters`)
  - **Film details** (`fetchFilms`)
  - **Homeworld information** (`fetchHomeworld`)
- The **`CharacterRepositoryImpl`** abstracts API logic, ensuring a **clean separation of concerns** and better maintainability.
- The **`HomeViewModel`** communicates with the repository to trigger API calls and manage UI updates.

This architecture ensures **modularity, reusability, and testability** across the application.

---

### üîÑ **Pagination: Handling Infinite Scrolling**
To enhance the browsing experience, the app implements **pagination**, allowing users to **load more characters dynamically** when scrolling.

- The SWAPI API provides a `next` field in its response, which contains the URL for the next page.
- The app **stores this `nextPageUrl`** and uses it when the user scrolls near the bottom.
- When `fetchMoreCharacters()` is triggered, it:
  - Sends a request to `nextPageUrl`
  - Appends new characters to the existing list
  - Updates `_nextPageUrl` for future requests
- This approach ensures **efficient data loading** without fetching unnecessary information all at once.

---

### üîç **Search: Dynamic & Optimized with Debounce**
To provide a **fast and optimized search experience**, the app implements a **debounce mechanism**.

- Instead of making an API request **on every keystroke**, the app **waits for 2 seconds** after the user stops typing before making a request.
- This is done using **a Timer**, which **cancels previous searches** if the user continues typing.
- If the user clicks the search button, an **instant search** is triggered.
- The API call uses SWAPI‚Äôs built-in **`?search=QUERY`** parameter, filtering results based on the input.

This technique significantly **reduces API requests**, improves app performance, and ensures a **smoother user experience**.

### ‚úÖ **Summary of Key Functionalities**
‚úî **Singleton API Service** (`BaseService`) manages network requests.  
‚úî **Repository Pattern** ensures a modular and structured architecture.  
‚úî **Pagination** dynamically loads more characters as the user scrolls.  
‚úî **Debounced Search** optimizes API calls, reducing unnecessary network requests.  
‚úî **Separation of Concerns** ensures easy maintenance and future scalability.  

With these features, the **SWAPI Explorer** app provides an efficient and enjoyable **Star Wars character browsing experience! üöÄüåå**
